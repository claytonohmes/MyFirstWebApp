# My first web app
# Notes
first need to make a folder inside your main project folder to house the app

## Flask
flask is a fast and simple tool to quickly build out your websites

pip install flask
pip install flask-login
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
    wraps sql to make it easier to use in flask.



## website
this is where the information for our website will live.

### Template
when you render html you call it a template. This folder is where all of your html will live.

- base.html
    the main style of your webpage. typically you will be overwriting your base with other elements.

### static

### auth.py

### models.py

### views.py

### __init__.py
initializes the website folder as a python package, allowing all the code inside the folder to run when we call the folder or start the app.

```python



### main.py
the main program that we will start when we want our website to run.
